"""Server instructions carry the rules that keep generated Blender code working.

The guidance used to live in an asset_creation_strategy prompt, but MCP prompts
are user-invoked and the model can't fetch one, so clients effectively got none.
That is how generated scripts ended up looking shader nodes up by localized name
(#26) and hardcoding render engine identifiers from a different Blender version
(#110).

These tests deliberately assert on API identifiers rather than prose, so the wording
stays free to change.

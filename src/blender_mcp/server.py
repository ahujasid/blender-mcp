SERVER_INSTRUCTIONS = """MCP for Blender drives the user's live Blender. You do the modelling, layout,
materials, animation and rigging yourself in Python with execute_blender_code; the other tools
give you what Python can't: eyes (look), 3D generation (generate_3d), asset libraries
(search_assets, import_asset), and guides (get_guide).

Start with get_addon_status (Blender version, available integrations) and get_scene_info.
Before rigging, retopology, animation, level design, scene building or materials work, load
the matching guide with get_guide; they carry the version pitfalls.

Scripts run in someone else's Blender:
- Look shader nodes up by type, never by name (names are localized):
  `next(n for n in mat.node_tree.nodes if n.type == "BSDF_PRINCIPLED")`.
- Never hardcode enum identifiers; read them, e.g.
  `[i.identifier for i in bpy.types.RenderSettings.bl_rna.properties["file_format"].enum_items]`.
  scene.render.engine under-reports: read the current value, and assign a new one inside
  try/except TypeError, whose message lists the valid engines.
- Material colors go on shader node inputs; material.diffuse_color only affects the viewport.

Verify visually. After each meaningful change, look at it with the mode that answers the
question (angles for shape and placement, camera for composition, topology, rig, frames for
motion). Judge the image, not your intent: fix anything floating, clipping, mis-scaled or
hidden before moving on.

Assets: generate hero and custom objects one at a time (never a whole scene, the ground, or
parts to assemble) and duplicate for repeats; use libraries for HDRIs, textures and generic
props. If get_addon_status lists premium_generators, follow its guidance. After any import,
use the reported world_bounding_box to fix scale and put the object on the ground."""

# - Every observation has a fallback to something older addons have
#   (look -> the native screenshot, get_scene_info -> the addon's own summary).

    See the scene. One image per call; pick the mode that answers your question.

    Modes:
    - viewport: exactly what the user's 3D viewport shows.
    - angles: a contact sheet of the target from several sides (default front, right, top,
      three_quarter), auto-framed. Best for checking shape, proportions, placement and clipping.
    - camera: through the scene camera, at the render aspect ratio. Use for composition.
    - topology: wireframe on matcap, plus per-mesh counts (tris/quads/ngons, non-manifold and
      boundary edges, loose verts, poles). Use for retopo and cleanup.
    - rig: X-ray with bones in front, plus armature stats and unweighted vertex counts.
    - frames: a strip of animation frames (evenly spaced over the frame range, or `frames`), to
      judge motion. Seen from the viewport, or `view="camera"` or an angle name.

    Parameters:
    - target: Object names to frame (children included). Default: every visible object.
    - views: For angles/topology/rig: any of front, back, left, right, top, three_quarter (max 6).
      topology and rig default to a single three_quarter view of the target.
    - shading: Override the viewport shading for this image: solid, material, rendered, wireframe.
      Materials only show in material or rendered. Rendered can be slow in Cycles.
    - frames / frame_count: For frames mode; explicit frame numbers, or how many to sample (2-12).
    - view: For frames mode: "camera", an angle name, or omit for the user's viewport.
    - max_size: Longest side of the image in pixels.

    - target_size: Size in metres of the model's largest dimension (chair 1.0, car 4.5, cup 0.12).
      Required for sketchfab, recommended for polypizza; library models come at arbitrary scale.
